# mission_to_mars
In this project we have a website dedicated to find the latest news on Mars missions and other NASA related topics. Everytime you press the "Scrape it! button", a flask aplication runs a series of functions that scrape the NASA website, stores the data in a Mongo database, and finally displays the latest news plus a few more details about Mars and Earth and some information about Mars hemispheres.
